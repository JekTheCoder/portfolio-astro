A fullstack project for a fully functional blog.

Composed of a backend server built with rust using a postgres db wich manages users auth and blogs with their comments. 
The development helped me to learn to use Domain Driven Development.

And the frontend is built with svelte and sveltekit using tailwind to built a custom theme a component system.

Continous integration is implemented with github actions.
